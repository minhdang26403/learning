- The first thing to do for every Go project is enabling dependency tracking: go mod init `module_name`. The module name will be the import path
- `go mod tidy` will update the `go.mod` file for any update related to dependency.
- If a package hasn't beem published yet, use `go mod edit -replace old=new` to update the `go.mod` file to find the file using the local file system path.
- Use `log` package to log the debugging information. We can set the log prefix, change the `log` flag to disable printing time, source file, and line number.
- `log.Fatal(err)` function prints the error and stops the program.
- Go executes init functions automatically at program startup, after global variables have been initialized.
